## Tree

A Charm bubbletea model for a representation of a tree-like structure, I had a filesystem in mind when creating this.

The model supports out of the box navigating through the tree using the directional keys (and `hjkl`) and also expanding/collapsing directory nodes using `Enter`.

Different symbols and lipgloss styles can be configured for the basic elements of the tree.
